# Manual checklist

Only work that needs a human: console access, dashboards, decisions, or accounts an agent can't use. Code work lives in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Tick items and add the date. The complete copy is on branch astro-rebuild (it has the Cloudflare/rebuild items); seo-fixes is merged into it regularly.

## Open

### Decisions
- [x] **Unpaid premium/credits accounts.** 8 accounts have premium or credits without any payment (beta-week sign-ups, Nov 24-28, 2025; one orphan doc `EIV569…` with no Auth user). Keep or revoke? - ANSWER: KEEP
- [x] **Bucket CORS.** Allow GET from `https://biblesketch.app` on the Storage bucket now, or wait for the rebuild (needed before any browser-side image editing; see ROADMAP 1.1). - ANSWER: ENABLED 2026-09-23 (verified: GET from biblesketch.app returns Access-Control-Allow-Origin)
- [ ] **"Remove Color" pricing.** Free (rate-limited) or 1 credit (ROADMAP 1.1).
- [x] **Thumbnail palette PNGs** (optional). Firebase console > Extensions > Resize Images (0.3.0) > Reconfigure: set output options to palette PNG. Smaller thumbnails; slightly lossy where verse text is colored, so check a few by eye.

### Google Cloud / Firebase console (confirm these were done in the Phase A hotfix)
- [ ] Gemini API: per-model quota caps and a billing budget alert.
- [x] Old Gemini keys deleted at the source; old secret versions disabled; current key restricted to the Generative Language API (API restriction only, no referrer restriction).
- [x] Auth > Authorized domains: remove the stale `bible-sketch-platform-267611631790.us-west1.run.app`.
- [ ] Monitoring alerts for generation failures (ROADMAP S1) — until then, try one generation on the live site each week.

### Cloudflare (Astro rebuild)
- [ ] **Test auth on the live phase 1 pages** (open https://biblesketch.app/about, use the header buttons): sign up with a new email, click the verification link (lands on /verified), log in, sign in with Google, open Profile Settings. The header buttons on these pages are the new code; the rest of the site is still the old app. Anything wrong: tell an agent to drop the prefix from `LIVE_PREFIXES` and redeploy (rollback in a minute).
- [ ] **Approve the phase 2 cutover** (after phase 1): the Worker takes `/coloring-page*`, `/tags*`, `/profile*` and `/api/*`, and `onSketchWritten` is deployed (secret + URL first, docs/deploying.md).
- [ ] (Optional, purge check 2c) After rollout phase 2 ships the trigger: make one of your own sketches private in the app, check its `/coloring-page/…` URL 404s within seconds, then make it public again.

### Zoho
- [ ] Make the customer "User ID" custom field read-only in the customer portal (ROADMAP S5).

### Recurring
- [ ] **Monthly:** run `node scripts/optimize-sketch-images.mjs --apply` (or ask an agent to), until a Storage trigger replaces it.
- [ ] **2-4 weeks after 2026-09-22:** Search Console > Pages and Sitemaps: soft 404s and duplicate-canonical counts should fall; the sitemap should show 338 discovered URLs with no errors.

## Done
- [x] 2026-09-23: Phase 1 cutover approved and live (about, privacy, terms, verified, blog on the Worker).
- [x] 2026-09-23: Phase 0 /labs probe routes deleted in the Cloudflare dashboard (`_astro/*` and `img/*` kept for phase 1).
- [x] 2026-09-23: Phase 1 copy changes approved as drafted (docs/copy-review-phase1.md). Set LAST_UPDATED in privacy/terms to the go-live date at cutover.
- [x] 2026-09-23: Workers Paid confirmed active on the Cloudflare account; Phase 0 zone probe routes approved.
- [x] 2026-09-22: Cloudflare purge of `/og.png`, `/logo.png`, Christmas blog cover; Email Obfuscation off; Bot Fight Mode decided.
- [x] 2026-09-22: Sitemap resubmitted in Search Console.
